if we use the array( to store the Treenodes as the queue) to create the bianry tree , it uses the fixed memory. so, as soon as requirement come up we need to enhance the memory space .
To over come that use the linked list to store the Treenodes as Queue. 
   - 
   - Easy to delete(delete the memory in side the queue will delete the tree entirely ) and
   - Time complexity also reduced
   - Easy to develop the code
